Irathient Development Hub
=========

Hello, and welcome to The Official Irathient GitHub.
We, at Irathient, strive to bring you the most relevant yet CUSTOM content you've seen in a RuneScape Private Server.
Irathient Staff are very much dependant on community-made decisions, and also community decided vote polls on the new content that should be added! We aren't just one of the servers you see that don't care about their community, and ignore the comments made on their forums. No, we choose to be different, so no one can tell us otherwise. We stand alone, backed up by reliable developers that have a good grip on their knowledge of Java, XML, Python, JSon, and Ruby scripting.
If you wish to watch the development of Irathient unfold, please make a GitHub account (Assuming you don't already have one) and click the "Watch" Button on the top right corner.
You'll be surprised as to what shall come of this server.

Thank you for your time,
Austin aka Snow, & Uwotm8.
